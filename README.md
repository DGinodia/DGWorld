Starting to explore using GitHub
Hello Friends,
I have decided to dive into coding again after 15 years. I used to develop and maintain applications in AS400 and I was good at it. I have had good mentors like Lito Sandiego who have taught me a great deal. 
Now I have grown in my career as a management consultant having worked with top tier strategy and management consulting firms serving as a trusted advisor for Fortune 500 organizations. 
Now I want to put all my experiences and learnings to use for good. I am passionate about creating technology that improves lives, sustainability and harmony. I wish to aim so high that it may not be achievable in this lifetime but my actions and progress would start a revolution. In my efforts I will leave the world a better place than what  I found. 

How? 
Stay tuned as I create projects using GitHub with specific purpose. If you are interested in joining, get in touch as its going to take an army to achieve this goal.
