Module 3 - Python Programming Fundamentals 
1. Conditions and Branching 
2. Loops 
3. Functions 
4. Objects and Classes

KEY CONCEPTS
Classify conditions and branching by identifying structured scenarios with outputs.
Understand loops by using visual examples and comparing them to tuples and lists.
Understand functions by building a function using inputs and outputs.
Explain objects and classes by identifying data types and creating a class.

1. Condition statements
		a. Comparison operators: can be applied to numbers, floats and strings
			i. equal: ==
			ii. not equal: !=
			iii. greater than: >
			iv. less than: <
			v. greater than or equal to: >=
			vi. less than or equal to: <=
			vii. ASCII comparison: ord()
			     Inequality operation is also used to compare the letters/words/symbols according to the ASCII value of 				 letters. The decimal value shown in the following table represents the order of the character:
				       1) For example, the ASCII code for ! is 21, while the ASCII code for + is 43. Therefore + is 						larger than ! as 43 is greater than 21.
				       2) Similarly, the value for A is 101, and the value for B is 102 therefore:
		b. Comparison operators: 
			i. if (comparison):
			ii. If (comparison): else:
			iii. If (comparison): elif (comparison): else:
		c. Logic Operators: 
			i. and
			ii. or
			iii. not
