# <h2 id="pandas">Introduction of <code>Pandas</code></h2>

# In[1]:


# Dependency needed to install file 

get_ipython().system('pip install xlrd')


# In[2]:


# Import required library

import pandas as pd


# After the import command, we now have access to a large number of pre-built classes and functions. This assumes the library is installed; in our lab environment all the necessary libraries are installed. One way pandas allows you to work with data is a dataframe. Let's go through the process to go from a comma separated values (<b>.csv</b>) file to a dataframe. This variable <code>csv_path</code> stores the path of the <b>.csv</b>, that is  used as an argument to the <code>read_csv</code> function. The result is stored in the object <code>df</code>, this is a common short form used for a variable referring to a Pandas dataframe. 

# In[3]:


# Read data from CSV file

csv_path = 'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%204/Datasets/TopSellingAlbums.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)


# We can use the method <code>head()</code> to examine the first five rows of a dataframe: 

# In[4]:


# Print first five rows of the dataframe

df.head()


#  We use the path of the excel file and the function <code>read_excel</code>. The result is a data frame as before:

# In[5]:


# Read data from Excel File and print the first five rows

xlsx_path = 'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%204/Datasets/TopSellingAlbums.xlsx'

df = pd.read_excel(xlsx_path)
df.head()


# We can access the column <b>Length</b> and assign it a new dataframe <b>x</b>:

# In[6]:


# Access to the column Length

x = df[['Length']]
x


#  The process is shown in the figure: 

# <img src="https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%204/Images/DataEgOne.png" width="750" />

# <hr>

# <h2 id="data">Viewing Data and Accessing Data</h2>

# You can also get a column as a series. You can think of a Pandas series as a 1-D dataframe. Just use one bracket: 

# In[7]:


# Get the column as a series

x = df['Length']
x


# You can also get a column as a dataframe. For example, we can assign the column <b>Artist</b>:

# In[9]:


# Get the column as a dataframe

x = type(df[['Artist']])
x


# You can do the same thing for multiple columns; we just put the dataframe name, in this case, <code>df</code>, and the name of the multiple column headers enclosed in double brackets. The result is a new dataframe comprised of the specified columns:

# In[10]:


# Access to multiple columns

y = df[['Artist','Length','Genre']]
y


# The process is shown in the figure:

# <img src = "https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%204/Images/DataEgTwo.png" width="1100" />

# One way to access unique elements is the <code>iloc</code> method, where you can access the 1st row and the 1st column as follows:

# In[11]:


# Access the value on the first row and the first column

df.iloc[0, 0]


# You can access the 2nd row and the 1st column as follows:

# In[12]:


# Access the value on the second row and the first column

df.iloc[1,0]


# You can access the 1st row and the 3rd column as follows: 

# In[14]:


# Access the value on the first row and the third column

df.iloc[0,2]


# You can access the column using the name as well, the following are the same as above: 

# In[13]:


# Access the column using the name

df.loc[0, 'Artist']


# In[15]:


# Access the column using the name

df.loc[1, 'Artist']


# In[16]:


# Access the column using the name

df.loc[0, 'Released']


# In[17]:


# Access the column using the name

df.loc[1, 'Released']


# You can perform slicing using both the index and the name of the column:

# In[18]:


# Slicing the dataframe

df.iloc[0:2, 0:3]


# In[19]:


# Slicing the dataframe using name

df.loc[0:2, 'Artist':'Released']

# <h2 id="quiz">Quiz on DataFrame</h2>

# Use a variable <code>q</code> to store the column <b>Rating</b> as a dataframe

# In[20]:


# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute
q=df[['Rating']]
q


# Double-click __here__ for the solution.
# 
# <!-- Your answer is below:
# q = df[['Rating']]
# q
# -->

# Assign the variable <code>q</code> to the dataframe that is made up of the column <b>Released</b> and <b>Artist</b>:

# In[21]:


# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute
q = df[['Released', 'Artist']]
q


# Double-click __here__ for the solution.
# 
# <!-- Your answer is below:
# q = df[['Released', 'Artist']]
# q
# -->

# Access the 2nd row and the 3rd column of <code>df</code>:

# In[22]:


# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute

df.iloc[1, 2]


# Double-click __here__ for the solution.
# 
# <!-- Your answer is below:
# df.iloc[1, 2]

# <h2>The last exercise!</h2>
# <p>Congratulations, you have completed your first lesson and hands-on lab in Python. However, there is one more thing you need to do. The Data Science community encourages sharing work. The best way to share and showcase your work is to share it on GitHub. By sharing your notebook on GitHub you are not only building your reputation with fellow data scientists, but you can also show it off when applying for a job. Even though this was your first piece of work, it is never too early to start building good habits. So, please read and follow <a href="https://cognitiveclass.ai/blog/data-scientists-stand-out-by-sharing-your-notebooks/" target="_blank">this article</a> to learn how to share your work.
