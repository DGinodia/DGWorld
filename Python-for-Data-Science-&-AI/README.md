<b>Python for Data Science: Cognitiveclass PY0101EN </b>

You can signup for the course at www.CognitiveClass.ai for a step by step lesson and receive a badge/certificate for completion.
The objectives of this course is to get you started with Python as the programming language and give you a taste of how to start working with data in Python. In this course you will learn about:

What is Python and why is it useful
The application of Python 
How to define variables
Sets and conditional statements in Python
The purpose of having functions in Python
How to operate on files to read and write data in Python
How to use pandas, a must have package for anyone attempting data analysis in Python.

This introduction to Python will kickstart your learning of Python for data science, as well as programming in general. This beginner-friendly Python course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours.
Upon its completion, you'll be able to write your own Python scripts and perform basic hands-on data analysis using Jupyter-based lab environment. If you want to learn Python from scratch, this course is for you. This course will not teach you everything about Python, but it should give you the tools to work as a data scientist and enough knowledge to continue to expand your Python learning. In the final project, you will load data and learn a new Python Library on your own.
